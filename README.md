Below are the questions asked for Journal 8.


## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a simulated client creating a driver's education system. They wanted to create a program accessible on any device with an internet connection. It was meant to be a system for booking reservations with instructors, taking practice exams, and other driver education services.

## What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well in mapping out the requirements needed for this project. I looked at it the same way I would with Mechanical Engineering projects; you want to define the scope of work as in depth as possible to ensure that scope creep does not occur whent he project is actually underway. Scope creep often times makes a project longer than necessary and results in you not being paid for the work done because it wasn't outlined in the original contract.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would revise my sequence diagram, simply because I would have chosen something with more steps to document so I could better show off my understanding of the tool. I would have also changed my login in activity diagram to include what happens if there are multiple incorrect password attempts. I would also change it to allow the user to submit multiple attempts if their password is incorrect instead of just going to end the session.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I think I did well in capturing the user's needs by making sure to include all of the major componenets they wanted in the system under the functional requirements. The nonfunctional requirements more came from my end in anticipation of what the user would need to have a better application. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they're the ones who actually have to live with the system on a daily basis. To give an example similar to HVAC, it's much easier to design for a noise not to be there, than to get rid of a noise once it exists. Meaning, it's much easier to design a system to meet the needs of the suer from the beginning than to try to edit it after the fact because the person will still be annoyed by the earlier error and more likely to nitpick any future issues.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think all of the UML diagrams were extremely useful in designing software and I would use them in the future. I specifically like the Activity Diagrams and the Class Diagram. These two make it very easy for me to see exactly how I would want to go about creating a program. They would be my stepping off point for creating pseudocode going into a project if necessary.
